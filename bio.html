        <br>
        <p>I was originally born in Upstate New York and moved to Arlington, Texas at the age of 10.<br>
        At 11, I moved to Albemarle, North Carolina where we stayed until I came to Raleigh to attend NCSU in 2003.<br><br>
        I graduated with a BS in Accounting, but am now a Sales Engineer for a Healthcare IT startup in Downtown Durham.<br>
        I bought a home in the same area where I live with my girlfriend Mechelle and our pitbull, Molly.</p>
